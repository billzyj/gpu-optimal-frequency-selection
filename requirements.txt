# GPU Optimal Frequency Selection - Python dependencies
#
# Notes:
# 1. The current three-stage EVeREST core (Phase Identification /
#    Phase Characterization / Frequency Scaling) runs on Python stdlib only.
# 2. Dependencies below are for experiment orchestration, analysis, and
#    vendor telemetry/control integration in later phases.

# ---- Common experiment/data utilities ----
numpy>=1.26,<3
pandas>=2.2,<3
scipy>=1.12,<2
matplotlib>=3.8,<4
pyyaml>=6.0,<7
tqdm>=4.66,<5

# ---- NVIDIA telemetry/control ----
# NVML Python binding (used with nvidia-smi/NVML-based control paths)
nvidia-ml-py>=12.0,<13

# ---- Vendor SDK notes (not pinned here) ----
# DCGM Python bindings are usually installed with NVIDIA DCGM system packages.
# ROCm SMI / AMD SMI Python bindings are usually installed via ROCm packages.
